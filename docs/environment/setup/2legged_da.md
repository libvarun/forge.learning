Choose your language: [Node.js](environment/setup/nodejs_2legged_da) | [.NET Core](environment/setup/netcore_2legged_da)

**1. Visual Studio**

Visual Studio 2019 or newer is required, please visit [this link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

**2. AutoCAD, Inventor or Revit**

In order to develop, test and debug your Design Automation plugin, the respective desktop application (i.e. engine) is required. To download and install, go to the respective page and download: [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview) | [Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview) | [Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview) | [3ds Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview).

**3. ngrok**

When Design Automation finishes modifying your model, it notifies back. As your machine is not exposed on the web, the [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tool create a temporary address to receive notifications. This tool is only required locally. 

After download, unzip it. Open the Windows **Command Line Prompt** (CMD) and navigate to the folder. Then run `ngrok http 3000 -host-header="localhost:3000"`. Copy the **forwarding** URL value (in the form of `http://1ab2c3d4.ngrok.com`)

> If running on non-Windows (e.g. MacOS), open the **Terminal** instead and follow the same steps.

!> **Warning**: `ngrok` exposes your localhost server to the web while it is in use. Be sure to turn it off when your testing it done. Do not use this outside development environment.
