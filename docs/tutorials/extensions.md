# Viewer extensions

Extensions provide a mechanism to write custom code that interacts with the **Viewer**. Each extension should register itself with the extension manager, providing a unique string ID which is then used to load or unload the extension during runtime. [Learn more](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Extensions/).

This tutorial will guide you creating an extension for Viewer. 

> For this tutorial you need an app with Viewer, for instance the [View your models](tutorials/viewmodels.md) or the [View BIM 360 & Fusion models](tutorials/viewhubmodels.md) tutorial. The Viewer is the same regardless where the file is hosted.
